# Official Repository: https://github.com/D35m0nd142/Joomla-Components-Exploits-Auto-Updating-Scanner

# This is a simple auto-updating Joomla! Plugins Scanner which is able to find exploits related to previously found components. 
# It uses the csv file provided by the Exploit-DB team and an extra plugins' list from Metasploit, but it is totally indipendent from this last one. 
# TOR Proxy tunnel is available.

# [FLOODING] If the target is protected by flooding requests the script won't be successful clearly.

# Script's Programming Language support: Python 2.7.* 

# *******************************************************************************************************************************************
# WARNING: You could have not installed some of the required libraries but it will install them for you PROVIDED you run the script as root.
#      	   Besides you need to install pip in order to get missing libraries quickly.
